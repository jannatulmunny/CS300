1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In the projects for this course, I focused on analyzing a fleet maintenance dataset to identify patterns and trends. The primary goal was to provide actionable insights to help the fleet management team at ABC University improve vehicle maintenance schedules, reduce downtime, and optimize part replacements.

2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by first understanding the dataset and its structure. I then created a plan to load the data into a suitable data structure, such as a binary search tree, which allowed for efficient data retrieval and manipulation. Understanding data structures was crucial as they provide the foundation for organizing and accessing data in an optimal manner. This helped in efficiently running queries to extract meaningful insights from the data.

3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I encountered several roadblocks during the project, such as handling data import errors and ensuring the data was correctly formatted for analysis. To overcome these issues, I systematically debugged the code, verified data integrity at each step, and used pseudocode to map out the logic before implementing it. Seeking help from resources like documentation and forums also proved beneficial.

4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working on this project has significantly expanded my approach to software design and development. I have learned the importance of planning and using pseudocode to outline the logic before diving into coding. It reinforced the need for selecting appropriate data structures based on the problem requirements, which can greatly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the solution.

5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project has evolved my programming style to prioritize maintainability, readability, and adaptability. I now focus more on writing clean, well-documented code with meaningful variable names and modular functions. This approach not only makes the code easier to understand and maintain but also ensures that it can be easily adapted for future enhancements or changes in requirements.

By reflecting on these aspects, I have gained a deeper understanding of best practices in software development, which will be invaluable in my future projects and career as a database user and data analyst.
